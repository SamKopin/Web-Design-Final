    <h2>Around 6,000 species of lizards on this planet, what's there to know about them?</h2>
    <p>While having the most variety of species in the reptile category, it's hard to know everything about these creatures.</p>
    <p>These reptiles are sorted into 16 families, many that are well known.</p>
